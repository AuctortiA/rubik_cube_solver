# Rubik Cube Solver

## Overview
This project is currently in progress. The datastructure representing the rubik's cube has been implemented in a very abstracted way, to allow various different solving algorithms to be implemented in the future.

## Running
### Dependencies
All modules used in this package are part of the standard python distribution.

### Running program (not yet completed)
